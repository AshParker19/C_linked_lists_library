Some functions I developed for my projects.

I made a nice function which connects 2 "rows" of the linked list for FdF
and there's a printing fucntion to test it inthe same file.

I have lots of functions, which I came up with for push_swap, most of them 
are just looking for something in the list or change some values. In this
project I finally understood recursion so I tried to make all the fucntions
related to linked lists working recursively.
